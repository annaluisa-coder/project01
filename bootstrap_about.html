	<div class="text-right"> We believe reading empowers people, offering them empathy to live for a moment in someone else’s shoes, offers them education, a critical asset to improving one’s life, and offers an occasional <b>escape</b> to fantastic worlds inhabited by interesting characters. Yes, we save millions of books every year from being destroyed, but our mission goes beyond the environment. We save these books and <u>make them accessible</u> to readers for the chance to shape another mind, share another story, and teach a bit of wisdom. <br> The company has grown into a global enterprise serving millions of customers worldwide with the help of a team of over 900 dedicated employees. We’ve learned a ton along the way, inventing systems and software as we grew, and that spirit of entrepreneurial innovation lives on today. We are all looking forward to seeing what comes next. It takes our role in the reading community seriously, and this is why we focus on 3 core tenets when it comes to our social responsibility. </p>
<h3> Charitable Support </h3>
	<p>Since its inception, our store has purchased books from charities allowing them to focus on doing good in the community and applying the funds towards programs that give back. Those books are, afterwards, donated to institutions in need.</p> 
<h3> Environmental Impact </h3>
	<p> There’s a lot to love about eBooks – they’re portable, can be accessed over the Internet, and they can be shared quickly and conveniently. Something most people don’t take into consideration when they say they love them, though, is that eBooks can be a greener choice than today’s physical books end up being. With more resources at low enough levels to impact environmental stability and more habitats being destroyed by deforestation and the search for fossil fuels, making even a small choice for a greener life can be important. So when you’re looking for that next little change that can help you have a bigger impact and thinking about switching to eBooks, here’s the rundown of how they help (and maybe even hinder) efforts towards green living.</p>
